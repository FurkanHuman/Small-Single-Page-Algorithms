# Small, simple, Effective.

**Hello Everyone;**

The purpose of this repo is to write simple algorithms in different programming languages.
It's going to be writing maths that puzzles me, or code that I say I'll use later, let alone the sidelines.

*Below will be a list of the codes I wrote and small descriptions.*

## List and Description.

- [exponential factorial calculation](github.com/FurkanHuman/Small-Single-Page-Algorithms/blob/master/Python/exponential-numbered-factor-calc.py "exponential factorial calculation"):
you can calculate the numbers with the base of this code.

- [collatz conjecture calculator](https://github.com/FurkanHuman/Small-Single-Page-Algorithms/blob/master/Python/Collatz-Calc.py "collatz conjecture calculator"):
*(will be updated.)* with this code you can make collatz conjecture calculations. calculate negative numbers and fractional numbers.

**If you want to add to these codes or think you can make them better, please comment.**
