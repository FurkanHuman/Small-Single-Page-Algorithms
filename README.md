# Small, simple, Effective.

**Hello Everyone;**

The purpose of this repo is to write simple algorithms in different programming languages.
It's going to be writing maths that puzzles me, or code that I say I'll use later, let alone the sidelines.

*Below will be a list of the codes I wrote and small descriptions.*

## List and Description.

- [exponential factorial calculation](https://github.com/FurkanHuman/Small-Single-Page-Algorithms/blob/master/Python/exponential-numbered-factor-calc.py "exponential factorial calculation")::
you can calculate the numbers with the base of this code.

**If you want to add to these codes or think you can make them better, please comment.**
